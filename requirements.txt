# physical-ai-stl - requirements.txt
#
# Goal: a CPU-friendly base environment that can (1) run the lightweight
# demos/scripts, (2) generate plots, and (3) monitor STL/STREL specs.
#
# Install (recommended):
#   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
#   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Notes
# -----
# * PyTorch is treated as an optional heavy dependency in this repo.
#   If you want to run the PINN training experiments, install a CPU wheel:
#     python -m pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu torch
#
# * MoonLight (STREL) requires a working Java runtime at run time.
#   If you see JVM errors, install a JRE/JDK (e.g., OpenJDK 17+) and ensure
#   `java` is on your PATH.
#
# Keep versions loosely pinned (major-bounded) to stay reproducible while
# remaining installable across common Python 3.10+ environments.
